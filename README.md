# LectureHook

LectureHook automates a Chrome browser to navigate to and download all of the lecture captures for a specified course. It is run at the command line and will require an input.

# Installation

This script requires some dependencies, and I am hoping to have a dependency script up soon. Until then, the required need to be installed:

- Chrome
- Python 3+
- Selenium
- python time
- python configparser
- python os, os.path, glob
